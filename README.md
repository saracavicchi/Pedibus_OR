# Pedibus_OR
Pedibus - Operations Research Project

Pedibus Problem:
Input data: The addresses of n children and the school’s location. The objective is to determine the minimum number of different paths starting from a child’s house, ending at the school, and possibly passing through other houses, such that:
 - Each child i belongs to exactly one path.
 - The length of the path from the child’s home to the school does not exceed Δ times their shortest distance to the school (i.e., Δ = 1.5).

Modified Objective Function:
 - Primary objective: Minimize the number of different paths.
 - Secondary objective: Minimize the sum of the durations of each path.
